Oskar Schindler, a German Nazi Party member from Czechoslovakia, arrives in the city, hoping to make his fortune. He bribes Wehrmacht (German armed forces) and SS officials, acquiring a factory to produce enamelware. Schindler hires Itzhak Stern, a Jewish official with contacts among black marketeers and the Jewish business community; he handles administration and helps Schindler arrange financing. Stern ensures that as many Jewish workers as possible were deemed essential to the German war effort to prevent them from being taken by the SS to concentration camps or killed. Meanwhile, Schindler maintains friendly relations with the Nazis and enjoys his new wealth and status as an industrialist.\\n\\nSS-Untersturmf\\u00fchrer (second lieutenant) Amon G\\u00f6th arrives in Krak\\u00f3w to oversee construction of the P\\u0142asz\\u00f3w concentration camp. When the camp is ready, he orders the ghetto liquidated: two thousand Jews are transported to P\\u0142asz\\u00f3w, and two thousand others are killed in the streets by the SS. Schindler witnesses the massacre and is profoundly affected. He particularly notices a young girl in a red coat who hides from the Nazis and later sees her body on a wagonload of corpses. Schindler is careful to maintain his friendship with G\\u00f6th and continues to enjoy SS support, mostly through bribery. G\\u00f6th brutalizes his Jewish maid Helen Hirsch and randomly shoots people from the balcony of his villa; the prisoners are in constant fear for their lives. As time passes, Schindler's focus shifts from making money to trying to save as many lives as possible. To better protect his workers, Schindler bribes G\\u00f6th into allowing him to build a sub-camp at his factory.\\n\\nAs the Germans begin losing the war, G\\u00f6th is ordered to ship the remaining Jews at P\\u0142asz\\u00f3w to Auschwitz concentration camp. Schindler asks G\\u00f6th for permission to move his workers to a munitions factory he plans to build in Br\\u00fcnnlitz near his hometown of Zwittau. G\\u00f6th reluctantly agrees but charges a huge bribe. Schindler and Stern prepare a list of people to be transferred to Br\\u00fcnnlitz instead of Auschwitz. The list eventually includes 1,100 names.\\n\\nAs the Jewish workers are transported by train to Br\\u00fcnnlitz, the women and girls are mistakenly redirected to Auschwitz-Birkenau; Schindler bribes Rudolf H\\u00f6ss, the commandant of Auschwitz, for their release. At the new factory, Schindler forbids the SS guards from entering the production area without permission and encourages the Jews to observe the Sabbath. Over the next seven months, he spends his fortune bribing Nazi officials and buying shell casings from other companies. Due to Schindler's machinations, the factory produces no usable armaments. He runs out of money in 1945, just as Germany surrenders.\\n\\nAs a Nazi Party member and war profiteer, Schindler must flee the advancing Red Army to avoid capture. The SS guards at the factory have been ordered to kill the Jewish workforce, but Schindler persuades them not to do so. Bidding farewell to his workers, he prepares to head west, hoping to surrender to the Americans. The workers give him a signed statement attesting to his role in saving Jewish lives and present him with a ring engraved with a Talmudic quotation: \\\"Whoever saves one life saves the world entire\\\". Schindler breaks down in tears, feeling he should have done more, and is comforted by the workers before he and his wife leave in their car. When the Schindlerjuden awaken the next morning, a mounted Soviet officer announces that they have been liberated but warns them not to go east because \\\"they hate you there\\\". The Jews then walk into the countryside.\\n\\nAn epilogue reveals that G\\u00f6th was convicted of crimes against humanity and executed via hanging, while Schindler's marriage and businesses failed following the war. In the present, many of the surviving Schindlerjuden and the actors portraying them visit Schindler's grave and place stones on its marker (a traditional Jewish sign of respect for the dead), after which Liam Neeson lays two roses.\",\n          \"While stuck in Los Angeles traffic, Sebastian \\\"Seb\\\" Wilder has a moment of road rage directed at aspiring actress Mia Dolan. After a hard day at work, Mia's next audition goes awry because the casting director takes a phone call during an emotional scene. That night, her roommates take her to a lavish party in the Hollywood Hills, promising her that someone in the crowd could jump-start her career. After her car is towed, she walks home in disappointment.\\n\\nDuring a gig at a restaurant, Seb slips into jazz improvisation despite the owner's warning to only play traditional Christmas pieces. Mia hears him playing as she passes by. Moved, she enters the restaurant and observes Seb being fired for his disobedience. Mia attempts to compliment him as he storms out, but he brushes by her. Months later, she runs into Seb at a party where he plays in a 1980s pop cover band. Mia requests that Seb play \\\"I Ran\\\" for her. After the gig, they walk to their cars and \\u2013 despite an obvious chemistry \\u2013 lament wasting a lovely night on each other.\\n\\nSeb arrives at Mia's workplace, and she shows him around the Warner Bros. backlot, where she works as a barista, while expressing her passion for acting. He takes her to a jazz club, describing his passion for jazz and his desire to open his own club. Seb invites Mia to a screening of Rebel Without a Cause and she accepts, forgetting a date with her boyfriend. Bored with the latter date, she rushes to the theater and finds Seb as the film begins. When the screening is interrupted by a projector malfunction, Seb and Mia spend the rest of the evening together with a romantic visit to the Griffith Observatory.\\n\\nAfter more failed auditions, Mia decides, with Seb's encouragement, to write a one-woman play. Seb begins to perform regularly at a jazz club, and the two of them eventually move in together. A former bandmate of Seb invites him to be the keyboardist in a new jazz fusion band, which will give him a steady income. Although dismayed by the band's pop style, Seb signs on after hearing Mia trying to convince her mother that he is working on his career. The band finds success, but Mia knows their music is not the type of music Seb wants to perform.\\n\\nDuring the band's first tour, Seb and Mia argue: she accuses him of abandoning his dreams, while he claims that she liked him more when he was unsuccessful because it made her feel better about herself. Two weeks later, Seb misses Mia's play because of a photoshoot he had forgotten about. The play fails, very few people attend, and Mia overhears dismissive comments about her performance. Unable to forgive him for missing her play and their previous argument, Mia returns to her hometown of Boulder City, Nevada.\\n\\nSeb receives a phone call from a prominent casting director who attended Mia's play, inviting her to audition for an upcoming film. Knowing that this could be her big break, he drives in a hurry to Boulder City and finds her house since he remembered that she lived across the street from the library, where she fell in love with acting. Seb persuades her to attend, and she reluctantly agrees to go.\\n\\nThe next morning, Seb picks her up, and Mia greets him with a coffee. During the audition, Mia is asked to tell a story. In response, she talks about how her aunt, a one-time stage actress who eventually died from alcoholism, inspired her to chase her dreams. Confident the audition was a success, Seb encourages Mia to devote herself to acting. The two then recognize that they will always love each other despite what may come for their relationship.\\n\\nFive years later, Mia is a famous actress and married to a different man, with whom she has a daughter. She is living a happy life. That night, the couple stumble upon a jazz bar. Recognizing the logo she had once designed, Mia realizes that Seb has opened his own jazz club. Seb notices Mia in the crowd and begins to play their love theme on the piano. The two imagine what their happy life together would have been had their relationship thrived along with their careers, then acknowledge each other with a silent exchange of smiles and go their separate ways.\",\n          \"Ellie Chu lives in the remote town of Squahamish with her grieving widower father, where she performs most of his station master and signalman duties. She makes extra money by ghostwriting essays for her classmates' assignments. The socially ostracized Ellie is secretly interested in Aster Flores, who happens to be reluctantly dating Trig, a narcissistic and popular boy from a wealthy family.\\n\\nEllie's next-door neighbor Paul Munsky, an inarticulate American footballer and future heir of a family sausage business, requests that Ellie help him ghostwrite a love letter to Aster. Ellie eventually agrees to help in order to help her household pay off its bills. Under the identity of Paul, Ellie begins a heartfelt correspondence with Aster about their shared interests in art and literature through letters and text messages.\\n\\nEllie's English teacher encourages her to apply to Grinnell College after noticing the proficiency of the essays she had ghostwritten for her classmates, but Ellie plans to attend the University of Washington and stay in Squahamish to remain with her father.\\n\\nEllie sets up Paul on a date with Aster, but his obtuse conversational skills hamper his interactions. Ellie planned to give up on helping Paul until he helps defend Ellie from bullies. Ellie starts teaching Paul about art and literature for him to keep up with his fake persona.\\n\\nEllie observes from afar that Paul's second date with Aster starts off as badly as the first. In a desperate bid to save the evening, Ellie sends Aster text messages via the user account secretly shared by the phones of both Ellie and Paul while Paul plays along by pretending to type on his phone. Paul on the following day divulges to Ellie that he had kissed Aster - without genuine approval or input from Aster, and even despite telling Aster to keep their relationship platonic - unnerving Ellie.\\n\\nPaul thwarts bullies' attempts to sabotage Ellie's music recital. Later, Paul stumbles upon letters from Ellie imploring renowned food critics to comment on Paul's original culinary innovations, and is filled with gratitude.\\n\\nAster takes Ellie to a secluded hot spring where they share an intimate conversation. Ellie discusses her own atheism, while Aster reveals that Trig intends to marry her. After Aster takes Ellie back to the latter's home, Aster stumbles upon Paul and verifies that he believes in God. From her bedroom window Ellie watches Paul and Aster kiss, upon which she decides to admit into Grinnell College.\\n\\nDuring Paul's football match, Aster cheers for Paul, but Paul is more thrilled by Ellie's cheers. Afterwards, mistakenly perceiving them to have developed feelings for each other, Paul attempts to kiss Ellie, but she rejects his advances. They notice an upset Aster observing them. Paul deciphers from Ellie's reaction that Ellie loves Aster. Due to his religious upbringing, he warns Ellie that she is in sin and will go to hell. Later, when Paul delivers his sausages to Ellie's father, they have a conversation about the meaning of love. Paul comes to terms with Ellie's sexuality and chooses to love her as she is.\\n\\nWitnessed by congregants from across the entire town, Trig proposes to Aster at church, only to be interjected by Ellie and then Paul, who lectures the congregants on love and authenticity. Aster recognizes Ellie's words written from a previous letter and realizes that it had been Ellie all along who had written the letters and text messages as Paul; she slaps Paul and storms out.\\n\\nBefore leaving for Grinnell College, Ellie apologizes to Aster for deceiving her. Aster admits her feelings for Ellie and her future in Grinnell's art school. Kissing Aster, Ellie tells her that she will see her in a couple of years.\\n\\nPaul, who is now confident about his career prospects, sees Ellie off at the train platform, promising to continue visiting her father. As per Ek Villain, a film they had previously watched together, Paul runs alongside Ellie's moving train, provoking Ellie's laughter along with tears.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Oskar Schindler, a German Nazi Party member from Czechoslovakia, arrives in the city, hoping to make his fortune. He bribes Wehrmacht (German armed forces) and SS officials, acquiring a factory to produce enamelware. Schindler hires Itzhak Stern, a Jewish official with contacts among black marketeers and the Jewish business community; he handles administration and helps Schindler arrange financing. Stern ensures that as many Jewish workers as possible were deemed essential to the German war effort to prevent them from being taken by the SS to concentration camps or killed. Meanwhile, Schindler maintains friendly relations with the Nazis and enjoys his new wealth and status as an industrialist.\\n\\nSS-Untersturmf\\u00fchrer (second lieutenant) Amon G\\u00f6th arrives in Krak\\u00f3w to oversee construction of the P\\u0142asz\\u00f3w concentration camp. When the camp is ready, he orders the ghetto liquidated: two thousand Jews are transported to P\\u0142asz\\u00f3w, and two thousand others are killed in the streets by the SS. Schindler witnesses the massacre and is profoundly affected. He particularly notices a young girl in a red coat who hides from the Nazis and later sees her body on a wagonload of corpses. Schindler is careful to maintain his friendship with G\\u00f6th and continues to enjoy SS support, mostly through bribery. G\\u00f6th brutalizes his Jewish maid Helen Hirsch and randomly shoots people from the balcony of his villa; the prisoners are in constant fear for their lives. As time passes, Schindler's focus shifts from making money to trying to save as many lives as possible. To better protect his workers, Schindler bribes G\\u00f6th into allowing him to build a sub-camp at his factory.\\n\\nAs the Germans begin losing the war, G\\u00f6th is ordered to ship the remaining Jews at P\\u0142asz\\u00f3w to Auschwitz concentration camp. Schindler asks G\\u00f6th for permission to move his workers to a munitions factory he plans to build in Br\\u00fcnnlitz near his hometown of Zwittau. G\\u00f6th reluctantly agrees but charges a huge bribe. Schindler and Stern prepare a list of people to be transferred to Br\\u00fcnnlitz instead of Auschwitz. The list eventually includes 1,100 names.\\n\\nAs the Jewish workers are transported by train to Br\\u00fcnnlitz, the women and girls are mistakenly redirected to Auschwitz-Birkenau; Schindler bribes Rudolf H\\u00f6ss, the commandant of Auschwitz, for their release. At the new factory, Schindler forbids the SS guards from entering the production area without permission and encourages the Jews to observe the Sabbath. Over the next seven months, he spends his fortune bribing Nazi officials and buying shell casings from other companies. Due to Schindler's machinations, the factory produces no usable armaments. He runs out of money in 1945, just as Germany surrenders.\\n\\nAs a Nazi Party member and war profiteer, Schindler must flee the advancing Red Army to avoid capture. The SS guards at the factory have been ordered to kill the Jewish workforce, but Schindler persuades them not to do so. Bidding farewell to his workers, he prepares to head west, hoping to surrender to the Americans. The workers give him a signed statement attesting to his role in saving Jewish lives and present him with a ring engraved with a Talmudic quotation: \\\"Whoever saves one life saves the world entire\\\". Schindler breaks down in tears, feeling he should have done more, and is comforted by the workers before he and his wife leave in their car. When the Schindlerjuden awaken the next morning, a mounted Soviet officer announces that they have been liberated but warns them not to go east because \\\"they hate you there\\\". The Jews then walk into the countryside.\\n\\nAn epilogue reveals that G\\u00f6th was convicted of crimes against humanity and executed via hanging, while Schindler's marriage and businesses failed following the war. In the present, many of the surviving Schindlerjuden and the actors portraying them visit Schindler's grave and place stones on its marker (a traditional Jewish sign of respect for the dead), after which Liam Neeson lays two roses.\",\n          \"While stuck in Los Angeles traffic, Sebastian \\\"Seb\\\" Wilder has a moment of road rage directed at aspiring actress Mia Dolan. After a hard day at work, Mia's next audition goes awry because the casting director takes a phone call during an emotional scene. That night, her roommates take her to a lavish party in the Hollywood Hills, promising her that someone in the crowd could jump-start her career. After her car is towed, she walks home in disappointment.\\n\\nDuring a gig at a restaurant, Seb slips into jazz improvisation despite the owner's warning to only play traditional Christmas pieces. Mia hears him playing as she passes by. Moved, she enters the restaurant and observes Seb being fired for his disobedience. Mia attempts to compliment him as he storms out, but he brushes by her. Months later, she runs into Seb at a party where he plays in a 1980s pop cover band. Mia requests that Seb play \\\"I Ran\\\" for her. After the gig, they walk to their cars and \\u2013 despite an obvious chemistry \\u2013 lament wasting a lovely night on each other.\\n\\nSeb arrives at Mia's workplace, and she shows him around the Warner Bros. backlot, where she works as a barista, while expressing her passion for acting. He takes her to a jazz club, describing his passion for jazz and his desire to open his own club. Seb invites Mia to a screening of Rebel Without a Cause and she accepts, forgetting a date with her boyfriend. Bored with the latter date, she rushes to the theater and finds Seb as the film begins. When the screening is interrupted by a projector malfunction, Seb and Mia spend the rest of the evening together with a romantic visit to the Griffith Observatory.\\n\\nAfter more failed auditions, Mia decides, with Seb's encouragement, to write a one-woman play. Seb begins to perform regularly at a jazz club, and the two of them eventually move in together. A former bandmate of Seb invites him to be the keyboardist in a new jazz fusion band, which will give him a steady income. Although dismayed by the band's pop style, Seb signs on after hearing Mia trying to convince her mother that he is working on his career. The band finds success, but Mia knows their music is not the type of music Seb wants to perform.\\n\\nDuring the band's first tour, Seb and Mia argue: she accuses him of abandoning his dreams, while he claims that she liked him more when he was unsuccessful because it made her feel better about herself. Two weeks later, Seb misses Mia's play because of a photoshoot he had forgotten about. The play fails, very few people attend, and Mia overhears dismissive comments about her performance. Unable to forgive him for missing her play and their previous argument, Mia returns to her hometown of Boulder City, Nevada.\\n\\nSeb receives a phone call from a prominent casting director who attended Mia's play, inviting her to audition for an upcoming film. Knowing that this could be her big break, he drives in a hurry to Boulder City and finds her house since he remembered that she lived across the street from the library, where she fell in love with acting. Seb persuades her to attend, and she reluctantly agrees to go.\\n\\nThe next morning, Seb picks her up, and Mia greets him with a coffee. During the audition, Mia is asked to tell a story. In response, she talks about how her aunt, a one-time stage actress who eventually died from alcoholism, inspired her to chase her dreams. Confident the audition was a success, Seb encourages Mia to devote herself to acting. The two then recognize that they will always love each other despite what may come for their relationship.\\n\\nFive years later, Mia is a famous actress and married to a different man, with whom she has a daughter. She is living a happy life. That night, the couple stumble upon a jazz bar. Recognizing the logo she had once designed, Mia realizes that Seb has opened his own jazz club. Seb notices Mia in the crowd and begins to play their love theme on the piano. The two imagine what their happy life together would have been had their relationship thrived along with their careers, then acknowledge each other with a silent exchange of smiles and go their separate ways.\",\n          \"Ellie Chu lives in the remote town of Squahamish with her grieving widower father, where she performs most of his station master and signalman duties. She makes extra money by ghostwriting essays for her classmates' assignments. The socially ostracized Ellie is secretly interested in Aster Flores, who happens to be reluctantly dating Trig, a narcissistic and popular boy from a wealthy family.\\n\\nEllie's next-door neighbor Paul Munsky, an inarticulate American footballer and future heir of a family sausage business, requests that Ellie help him ghostwrite a love letter to Aster. Ellie eventually agrees to help in order to help her household pay off its bills. Under the identity of Paul, Ellie begins a heartfelt correspondence with Aster about their shared interests in art and literature through letters and text messages.\\n\\nEllie's English teacher encourages her to apply to Grinnell College after noticing the proficiency of the essays she had ghostwritten for her classmates, but Ellie plans to attend the University of Washington and stay in Squahamish to remain with her father.\\n\\nEllie sets up Paul on a date with Aster, but his obtuse conversational skills hamper his interactions. Ellie planned to give up on helping Paul until he helps defend Ellie from bullies. Ellie starts teaching Paul about art and literature for him to keep up with his fake persona.\\n\\nEllie observes from afar that Paul's second date with Aster starts off as badly as the first. In a desperate bid to save the evening, Ellie sends Aster text messages via the user account secretly shared by the phones of both Ellie and Paul while Paul plays along by pretending to type on his phone. Paul on the following day divulges to Ellie that he had kissed Aster - without genuine approval or input from Aster, and even despite telling Aster to keep their relationship platonic - unnerving Ellie.\\n\\nPaul thwarts bullies' attempts to sabotage Ellie's music recital. Later, Paul stumbles upon letters from Ellie imploring renowned food critics to comment on Paul's original culinary innovations, and is filled with gratitude.\\n\\nAster takes Ellie to a secluded hot spring where they share an intimate conversation. Ellie discusses her own atheism, while Aster reveals that Trig intends to marry her. After Aster takes Ellie back to the latter's home, Aster stumbles upon Paul and verifies that he believes in God. From her bedroom window Ellie watches Paul and Aster kiss, upon which she decides to admit into Grinnell College.\\n\\nDuring Paul's football match, Aster cheers for Paul, but Paul is more thrilled by Ellie's cheers. Afterwards, mistakenly perceiving them to have developed feelings for each other, Paul attempts to kiss Ellie, but she rejects his advances. They notice an upset Aster observing them. Paul deciphers from Ellie's reaction that Ellie loves Aster. Due to his religious upbringing, he warns Ellie that she is in sin and will go to hell. Later, when Paul delivers his sausages to Ellie's father, they have a conversation about the meaning of love. Paul comes to terms with Ellie's sexuality and chooses to love her as she is.\\n\\nWitnessed by congregants from across the entire town, Trig proposes to Aster at church, only to be interjected by Ellie and then Paul, who lectures the congregants on love and authenticity. Aster recognizes Ellie's words written from a previous letter and realizes that it had been Ellie all along who had written the letters and text messages as Paul; she slaps Paul and storms out.\\n\\nBefore leaving for Grinnell College, Ellie apologizes to Aster for deceiving her. Aster admits her feelings for Ellie and her future in Grinnell's art school. Kissing Aster, Ellie tells her that she will see her in a couple of years.\\n\\nPaul, who is now confident about his career prospects, sees Ellie off at the train platform, promising to continue visiting her father. As per Ek Villain, a film they had previously watched together, Paul runs alongside Ellie's moving train, provoking Ellie's laughter along with tears.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"embeddings\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
